    <ul>
        <li>
            As a Taekwondo Assistant and Lead Instructor, I had the opportunity to teach martial arts to children and adults of various
            ages, focusing on fundamental principles like courtesy, integrity, perseverance, and self-control while engaging in
            intense exercise, competition, and self-defense.

        <li>
            I also worked in a separate class teaching children with special needs and disabilities. It was challenging at times,
            but watching them grow and improve their skills was extremely rewarding, and I grew in patience and leadership in ways I otherwise
            might not have had the chance to.
